    <h3>Student ID Number: ALT/SOE/023/3040.</h3>
    <p>
      An igbo girl from ebonyi state, Nigeria and i am 23 years of age and also
      a student of Altschool Africa currently studying backend engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      I joined the 2023 program in Altschool with the sole aim of making a
      change in the world no matter how little through projects that would help
      the community in one way or the other, and to also secure my future and
      become financially stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plan on achieving the aforementioned and more through dedication,
      consistency and hardwork. Making a change in the world starts from oneself
      and that is what i'm on the path of doing. stength from God is all i
      desire to keep pushing.
